	*Four Pillars
	*1. Abstraction
	*	Essential features of an object.
	*
	*2. Encapsulation
	*	You only get what you actually need.
	*
	*3. Inheritance 
	*	Allows classes to inherit from parent classes
	*
	*4. Polymorphism 
	*	Animals communicate differently, therefore the method communicate can take different forms
	*
	*
	*Class - how we structure our code in OOP
	*Class is a blue print. Object is the actual product developed from the class.
